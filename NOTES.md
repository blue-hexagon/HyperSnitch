Adding a hostname into the MX record simply means that you are specifying the mail servers for a subdomain. For example adding an MX record for hostname "sales", FQDN mail.salesserver.be with priority 10 would mean that e-mails sent to @sales.yourdomain.be will be delivered to the mail server mail.salesserver.be.28 Sept 2023
